UFLDL Tutorial
==============

<!-- Jump to: [navigation](#column-one), [search](#searchInput) -->
**Description:** This tutorial will teach you the main ideas of Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning. By working through it, you will also get to implement several feature learning/deep learning algorithms, get to see them work for yourself, and learn how to apply/adapt these ideas to new problems.

This tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of machine learning (specifically, familiarity with the ideas of supervised learning, logistic regression, gradient descent). If you are not familiar with these ideas, we suggest you go to this [Machine Learning course](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/CoursePage.php?course=MachineLearning) and complete
sections II, III, IV (up to Logistic Regression) first.
