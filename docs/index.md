Deep Learning is a rapidly growing area of machine learning. To learn more, check
out our [deep learning tutorial](tutorial/index.md).
(There is also an [older version](wiki/UFLDL_Tutorial.md),
which has also been translated into [Chinese](wiki/UFLDL教程.md);
we recommend however that you use the [new version](tutorial/index.md).)

Machine learning has seen numerous successes, but applying learning algorithms
today often means spending a long time hand-engineering the input feature
representation. This is true for many problems in vision, audio, NLP,
robotics, and other areas. To address this, researchers have developed
deep learning algorithms that automatically learn a good representation for
the input. These algorithms are today enabling many groups to achieve ground-breaking
results in vision, speech, language, robotics, and other areas.

Our [deep learning tutorial](tutorial/index.md)
will teach you how to apply these algorithms to your own problems.
