### Starter Code

---

You can obtain starter code for all the exercises from this [Github Repository](https://github.com/amaas/stanford_dl_ex)

The data files are downloadable from [here](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/data.zip). The data needs to be extracted into the “common” folder found in the starter code.
